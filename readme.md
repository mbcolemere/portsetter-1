To install simply run the install.sh file from a bash terminal! (command: "sudo bash install.sh")

All included files must be in the same directory as the install.sh when run.
The usage files will be placed in the /files/setport directory of the current user.

After install the program will run as "setport"
For help use "setport -h" or "setport --help"

Additional testing added for CO5 from Matthew Colemere. In the portsetter directory, run the
file by simply typing ./mattTest.cpp.o to get the test outputs and results.
